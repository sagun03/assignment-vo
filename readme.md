# Assignment: Optimizing v0-Generated Code for Production-Ready 🚀

## Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing code that was generated by a version 0 (v0) prototype for production environments. The goal is to refactor and enhance the v0-generated code for better performance, scalability, and maintainability, while keeping the core functionality intact.

## Project Structure 📂

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **client/**: Contains the frontend code, built using **Next.js**.
- **server/**: Contains the backend/server code that handles API requests and data processing.
- **codeByV0/**: Contains the original **v0-generated code**, which will be optimized for production.

## Available Scripts 🎬

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts using either `npm run <script>` or `yarn <script>`.

### 1. Install Dependencies 🛠️

Before starting the application, you'll need to install dependencies for both the server and the client.

#### Server

Navigate to the `server/` directory and install the server dependencies:

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

#### Client

Navigate to the `client/` directory and install the client dependencies:

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Server ⚡

To start the `backend/server`, go to the `server/` directory and run the following command:

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

Once the server is up and running, you can access Swagger to add sample data or interact with your API.

### 3. Start the Client 🌐

To start the `frontend/client`, navigate to the `client/` directory and run the following command:

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

### 4. Add data using Swagger 🌐

Naviagte to to this url: `http://localhost:8080/api-docs`, 

Type:
```bash
export type ActivityType = 'pageView' | 'click' | 'formSubmission' | 'error' | 'apiCall';

export interface ActivityLog {
  id: string;
  timestamp: string;
  userId: string;
  type: ActivityType;
  description: string;
}
```

Example of data

```bash
{
  id: '1',
  timestamp: '2025-03-18T12:00:00Z',
  userId: 'user123',
  type: 'pageView',
  description: 'User viewed the homepage.',
};

{
    id: '2',
    timestamp: '2025-03-18T12:05:00Z',
    userId: 'user124',
    type: 'click',
    description: 'User clicked on the "Sign Up" button.',
  },

 {
    id: '3',
    timestamp: '2025-03-18T12:10:00Z',
    userId: 'user123',
    type: 'formSubmission',
    description: 'User submitted the registration form.',
  },

{
    id: '4',
    timestamp: '2025-03-18T12:15:00Z',
    userId: 'user125',
    type: 'error',
    description: 'User encountered a 500 server error.',
  },

   {
    id: '5',
    timestamp: '2025-03-18T12:20:00Z',
    userId: 'user124',
    type: 'apiCall',
    description: 'User made an API call to fetch user data.',
  },

```

### 4. Test Cases 🧪

Run the test cases to ensure everything is working as expected:

```bash
npm run test
```
