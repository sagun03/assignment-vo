# Assignment: Optimizing v0-Generated Code for Production-Ready 🚀

## Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing code that was generated by a version 0 (v0) prototype for production environments. The goal is to refactor and enhance the v0-generated code for better performance, scalability, and maintainability, while keeping the core functionality intact.

## Project Structure 📂

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **client/**: Contains the frontend code, built using **Next.js**.
- **server/**: Contains the backend/server code that handles API requests and data processing.
- **codeByV0/**: Contains the original **v0-generated code**, which will be optimized for production.

## Available Scripts 🎬

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts using either `npm run <script>` or `yarn <script>`.

### 1. Install Dependencies 🛠️

Before starting the application, you'll need to install dependencies for both the server and the client.

#### Server

Navigate to the `server/` directory and install the server dependencies:

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

#### Client

Navigate to the `client/` directory and install the client dependencies:

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Server ⚡

To start the `backend/server`, go to the `server/` directory and run the following command:

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

Once the server is up and running, you can access Swagger to add sample data or interact with your API.

### 3. Start the Client 🌐

To start the `frontend/client`, navigate to the `client/` directory and run the following command:

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test Cases 🧪

Run the test cases to ensure everything is working as expected:

```bash
npm run test
```
